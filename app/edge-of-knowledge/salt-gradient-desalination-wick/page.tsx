        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          This document records a regime-bounded negative result evaluating a
          proposed membrane-free desalination mechanism based on layered
          hygroscopic salts and capillary transport. The concept was assessed
          for potential use in survival, humanitarian, or agricultural contexts
          where power, pressure, and membranes are unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evaluation concludes that the mechanism cannot achieve true or
          sustained desalination under passive conditions. The limitation is
          fundamental, not engineering-contingent, and arises from equilibrium
          thermodynamics and ion co-transport.
        </p>

        <h2>Proposed Mechanism (Evaluated)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Layered hygroscopic salts create local water activity gradients</li>
          <li>Capillary structures transport absorbed water</li>
          <li>No membranes, pressure, heat, electricity, or phase change</li>
          <li>Fully passive operation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Physical Impossibility Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Hygroscopic absorption and capillary action alone cannot provide
          selective transport of water without ions. In the absence of a
          unidirectional driving force or selective barrier, salt ions diffuse
          alongside water until chemical potentials equalize.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any initial reduction in apparent salinity is transient and collapses
          as the system approaches equilibrium. The mechanism reduces to salt
          sequestration and water redistribution, not desalination.
        </p>

        <h2>Kill Conditions (Empirically Testable)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Output water ion concentration equals or exceeds input after brief
            operation
          </li>
          <li>
            No sustained salinity reduction after hygroscopic layer saturation
          </li>
          <li>
            Passive operation halts without external energy or regeneration
          </li>
          <li>
            Salt diffusion into collected water overwhelms any transient effect
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Regime Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          This mechanism fails outright in seawater, high-salinity brines, or
          any context requiring potable or agricultural water. At best, it
          produces milliliter-scale, short-lived salinity perturbations in very
          low-salinity inputs before equilibrium collapse.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Risk</h2>
        <p>
          Overclaiming this mechanism as desalination presents a direct risk of
          harm, particularly in survival or humanitarian contexts. Reliance on
          this approach could displace proven methods (boiling, solar stills,
          membrane filtration) and result in ingestion of unsafe water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any deployment implying potable output is scientifically false and
          ethically unacceptable.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>NO-GO — THERMODYNAMICALLY FALSIFIED</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The salt-gradient desalination wick cannot achieve true, sustained, or
          safe desalination under passive, membrane-free conditions. The failure
          is fundamental and not recoverable through optimization, geometry, or
          material substitution within the stated constraints.
        </p>
